# Physics Projects 
Under development and also just for fun/practice. This will be a set of files that recreate programs I've worked on for an upper undergraduate level computational physics course. Here they will be adapted to Python with TCL/Tk instead of SwiftUI. Look up Jeff Terry for better advice on SwiftUI and computational programming in general, he's one of my undergrad professors for this stuff.

## Progress
  <!-- Test simple button, probably will be deleted from the GitHub repo soon. -->
  - test simple button: just a very simple GUI with a button added to it. 
  - volumeCubeClass: Fully functioning example of how the GUI works with only one option.
  - volumeProgram: code contains the options for both a cube class and a sphere class, but only the sphere class is running on the GUI at the moment.
    - Next step is to add a "picker" to the GUI that will allow user to switch between cube and sphere
    - Options for other shapes (i.e.: rectangular prism, triangular prism, etc) will be added in the distant (perhaps very distant, meaning potentially never since this is really just for fun/pracice anyway) future.

## tkinter
Tkinter is the package needed for the GUI. It's fun.
